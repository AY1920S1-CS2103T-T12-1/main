== Introduction
=== About The Team
grpup of 4, second year computing students (brief description of team)

=== About The Project
+Work is a project management tool that allows you to successfully achieve your objectives for your project.
It is aimed at NUS project leaders who are in charge of a small project group of less than 20 people.
+Work is a one-stop application to help you manage your members, meeting times, task allocations as well as personal claims for equipment purchased.
Take full advantage of our Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the all the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

What it is, what does it do (mention the main features)

== Summary of Contributions
* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_
