== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability for users to customise the appearance in +Work*
** What it does: allows the user to toggle the theme of the app between light and dark. Also, allows the user to toggle the
deadline display format of the app between 24hr and 12hr.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as +Work can adapt to their preferences. Furthermore, as +Work scales to `v2.0`, it would be easier for users and developers alike to
handle the complexity in may bring.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. +
The implementation was moderately difficult as I was able to adapt the integration of the
settings component based on the implementation of the existing `UserPrefs` component. The more difficult aspect was to design the component in such a way where it would be easy to extend its functionality
in the event more user settings are to be added. I tried to incorporate as much of the OOP principles as possible so as to
make the feature more robust.
** Credits: _Adapted the code to do responsive highlighting for the settings page from a course mate.
{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: Added the ability for users to add, edit, remove and set status for tasks.
