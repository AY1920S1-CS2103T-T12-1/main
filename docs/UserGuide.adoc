== Introduction

+Work is a project management tool that allows the project leader of a small group (less than 20 people) to manage this group to achieve their objectives for a single project. To increase efficiency of the group we help the group manage their meeting times, task allocation as well as personal claims for equipment purchased. Enjoy!
