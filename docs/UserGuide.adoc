== Introduction

+Work is a project management tool that allows students to successfully achieve your objectives for their project.
It is aimed at NUS project leaders who are in charge of a small project group of less than 20 people.
+Work is a one-stop application to help you manage your members, meeting times, task allocations as well as equipment purchased.
Take full advantage of our Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the all the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Happy working!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `pluswork.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your +Work.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Here are some commands you can try to get you started!:

* **`add-member mn/Adam Smith mi/AS`** : Adds a member with name "Adam Smith" to the project.
* **`add-task tn/Finish up milestone setting`** : Adds a task with name "Finish up milestone" to the project.
* **`assign ti/1 mi/JD`** : Assigns the project member "John Doe" (with member id "JD"), to the task "Finish up milestone setting".
* **`doing-task ti/1`** : Changes status of task "Finish up milestone setting"  to `doing`:

'''
// end::Statistics[]

// start::Multiline[]
=== Multiline Commands

==== Adding a task: `add-task`
As mentioned in the earlier part of user guide, to add a task to the project, use the add-task command in the format below. This will result in a series of questions that allow you to add deadline and a member to the task. The following flowchart shows this series of feedbacks from the application and user inputs.

image::ml-task_1.PNG[]

Format (to add task): `add-task [t/TASK_NAME]` +
Format (for yes): `yes` +
Format (for no): `no` +
Format (to add deadline and member): `add-d [at/DEADLINE] [mi/MEMBER_ID]`

[NOTE]
`add-d` command does not work unless it is typed after `add-task` and `yes`. +
Either deadline or member or both can be added using the `add-d` command. However at least one attribute must be present.

Example:

* `add-task tn/Finish Portfolio s/unbegun tt/Education`  +
A new task will be added to the project dashboard, which prompts a sequence of questions, as shown in the following pictures

** First, type the add-task command

image::ml-task_2_1.PNG[]

** This prompts the feedback asking for your choice to add deadline and member

image::ml-task_2_2.PNG[]

** Type yes to add deadline or member

image::ml-task_2_3.PNG[]

** This prompts to add the details

image::ml-task_2_4.PNG[]

** Type `add-d at/10/12/2019 18:00 mi/AR` to set deadline at 10/10/2019 18:00 and assign the member with member id “AR” to the task.

image::ml-task_2_5.PNG[]

** This sets the deadline and assigns the member successfully! You should see a window like this.

image::ml-task_2_6.PNG[]

==== Changing a task status to done: `done-task` +
(for tasks that are tagged “Inventory”)

As mentioned in the earlier part of user guide, to change the task status to “done”, use the done-task command in the format below. If the task is tagged as kbd:[Inventory], this will result in a series of questions that allow you to add the task as an inventory. The following flowchart shows this series of feedbacks from the application and user inputs.

image::ml-task_3.PNG[]

Format (for done task): `done-task [ti/TASK_ID]` +
Format (for yes): `yes` +
Format (for no): `no` +
Format (to add price and member): `add-i [p/PRICE] [mi/MEMBER_ID]`

[NOTE]
`add-i` command does not work unless it is typed after `done-task` and `yes`. +
Unlike `add-task`, in this case both attributes price and member id are required.

Example:

* `done-task ti/8` +
The task with index 8 will have its task status changed to done. Since the task is tagged as “Inventory”, this will prompt a series of questions, as shown in the pictures below.

** First, type done-task ti/8

image::ml-task_4_1.PNG[]

** This prompts the feedback asking for your choice to add it as an inventory.

image::ml-task_4_2.PNG[]

** After typing `yes` as the user input, feedback will prompt you to add the details.

image::ml-task_4_3.PNG[]

** Type `add-i p/5.50 mi/AB` to set the price at $5.50 and to assign the member with member id “AB” to the inventory

image::ml-task_4_4.PNG[]

** This sets the price and assigns the member successfully! You should see a window like this.

== FAQ

*Q*: Can I use file formats other than ics for the calendar feature? +
*A*: No, the file format has to be in ics folder, downloaded either from NUSmods or Google Calendar.

*Q*: Can I export the claims report as a word document? +
*A*: No, the application only supports exporting of files in PDF format.

*Q*: What if the calendar cannot find a timing where everyone is free? +
*A*: There will be a grid showing the number of available members by time, so it will be easier for the user to choose the best possible time for the meeting.

*Q*: My project has a budget, does the application help me keep track of the projects financial status? +
*A*: Using /inventory the application can keep track of current expenses for each task and the member who purchased it, however, there are currently no accounting services available.

*Q*: Some of the tasks for my project require sub tasks to be completed, is there a way to add them? +
*A*: Ideally since the user is the project leader, they should only see the main tasks to be accomplished for the project. This would help facilitate their managerial role within the project. Hence, the application does not support subtasks.

*Q*: How can I add multiple users to the same task? +
*A*: Since +Work is member-oriented, the application displays information according to members. Hence, you have to assign task to all the different members that are working on the task.

*Q*: What happens when a task has been completed? +
*A*: You can mark the task as `done`, which will move the task to the bottom of the task list. In the case where you do not want to keep the task in the list, using ‘Remove Task’ will delete it.
