<div class="paragraph">
<p>This project portfolio details my contributions to a Software Engineering group project, where my
team and I created the Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop application, +Work. It also serves to document the
key features I implemented in the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="about-the-team"><a class="link" href="#about-the-team">1.1. About The Team</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are a group of 5 Year 2 NUS Computer Science students, who worked together to create the CLI application, +Work.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="about-the-project"><a class="link" href="#about-the-project">1.2. About The Project</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>+Work is a CLI application created by my team for NUS School of Computing&#8217;s CS2103T Software Engineering module.
In this module, each team is required to morph or enhance an existing CLI AddressBook application, to fit the needs of a
target group of users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our application, +Work, is a project management tool aimed at NUS project leaders who are in charge of a small project
group. It allows project leaders to manage their members, meeting times, task allocations as well as personal claims for items purchased.
A user can use +Work to find the most popular meeting time among his project members when calling for a meeting, and even add project tasks and members that are assigned under these tasks, into +Work to better manage the project
manpower.</p>

<p>This section details all of my contributions to the project, and showcases how I worked on different aspects of the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="enhancements"><a class="link" href="#enhancements">2.1. Enhancements</a></h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: I added the ability to retrieve the overall statistics of tasks and members in +Work.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: This feature allows the user to retrieve statistics relating to tasks and members in +Work, including the
number of tasks and inventory items allocated to each member, and the proportion of tasks of different statuses, along with
the time spent on each task added into +Work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature increases the functionality of +Work because it gives the user a broad overview of the
project&#8217;s progress and members' responsibility allocation at a glance, which is one of the main goals of effective project management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: The statistics are displayed in the form of a Pie-Chart for easy comparison of data at a glance.
Implementation of the statistics code also requires the use of a newly introduced
mapping concept our team added to +Work, and required extensive consideration in the integration of the two implementations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: I added the ability for users to work with (add, delete, list, set image for) project members in +Work.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: This feature allows both members and tasks to be managed in one application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it adds another aspect of project management (member management) into +Work,
and allows different tasks and members to be assigned to one another. This allows
users to be able to draw connections between tasks and members when managing the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: One of the unique features that "Member" has is the ability to be assigned profile pictures. Users can
link an image on their laptop to a specific member in +Work, to set the image as the member&#8217;s profile photo. This was
challenging to implement because I had to ensure the UI would be able to accurately display the profile picture of each
member in an appealing way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Created the UI for members in +Work, which can include members' profile photos, as well as list tasks allocated to
each member under individual member cards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Created the UI of statistics calculated, and made sure it was in an easy-to-read format</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added test cases for all additional commands and classes related to Members and Statistics</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="statistics-feature"><a class="link" href="#statistics-feature">4.1. Statistics feature</a></h4>

<h5 id="implementation"><a class="link" href="#implementation">4.1.1. Implementation</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The commands introduced by this statistics feature includes: <code>task-stats</code> and <code>member-stats</code>. These commands are facilitated by the class 'Statistics'
that resides within model. The 'Statistics' class implements the following operations:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Statistics#doCalculations()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Calculates the statistics needed using existing list of tasks, members and mappings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Statistics#getPortionMembersByTasks()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Retrieves statistics of all the members and number of tasks completed by the each individual member.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Statistics#getPortionMembersByItems()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Retrieves statistics of all the members and number of items purchased by the each individual member.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Statistics#getPortionTasksByStatus()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Retrieves statistics of all existing tasks and number of tasks of each status.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These operations are exposed in the <code>Model</code> interface as <code>Model#doCalculations</code>, and <code>Model#getStatistics</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Statistics mechanism behaves at each step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> The user launches the application for the first time. The 'Statistics' object stored by ProjectDashboard is initialised based on the data previously saved.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> The user executes the <code>task-stats</code> command to retrieve statistics related to the tasks in the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>task-stats</code> command obtains the lists of all the members, tasks and mappings saved in the application, and uses the lists to form a Statistics object.
<code>Model#setStatistics</code> is then called to updated the statistics in ProjectDashboard.</p>

<p>Because the team came to a consensus that the main objective of the Statistics feature in +Work is to provide the user with
an overview of all the project tasks and members, for ease of comparison, <strong>Alternative 1</strong> was chosen as it fits the purpose
more than Alternative 2 does.</p>

<p>The member feature introduces the ability for +Work to deal with project members, in the same way it deals with project tasks.
This makes +Work a more comprehensive application because project tasks and members can be kept track of together.</p>

<p>+Work&#8217;s members and their related commands are supported by a <code>Member</code> class that resides within model.
The following class diagram exposes the structure of the Member class, and shows how the different components relating to the Member class works together.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apart from the typical commands (<code>add-member</code>, <code>delete-member</code>, <code>find-member</code>) involved in such a central class, the member feature also introduces a <code>set-image</code> command.
The <code>set-image</code> command allows users to set an image in their computer as the profile picture of a member in +Work.
To accommodate the <code>set-image</code> command, the <code>Member</code> class has an alternative constructor that takes in the image filepath as a parameter to save it as an attribute to the member object, when <code>set-image</code> command is called.
Additionally, to support the command, the <code>Member</code> class implements the following operation:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Member#getImagePath()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Retrieves the filepath of the image stored in the user&#8217;s computer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Member#getImage()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Retrieves the member&#8217;s image using the image filepath</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example usage scenario and how the set-image mechanism behaves at each step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> The user launches the application for the first time, and adds a team member into +Work. The member is displayed with a default profile picture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> The user executes the <code>set-image</code> command to set an image in their computer as the profile picture of a member in +Work..</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>set-image</code> command calls <code>Model#getFilteredMembersList()</code> to retrieve the Member that is to be edited.
A new member object is formed, with all the same parameters as the specified member object, and a new Image Filepath parameter.
<code>Model#setMember</code> is called to replace the old member object with the new one in +Work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sequence diagram shows how the 'set-image' operation works.</p>

</td>
<td class="content">
The image&#8217;s file path is stored in the Member object. If the image is shifted to another location, the file path stored becomes invalid, and the user has to call the <code>set-image</code> command again, with the new file path.

</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> When an operation is called to display a member, <code>Member#getImage</code> is called to display the image using Javafx&#8217;s ImageView.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sequence diagram shows how the image is called up and subsequently displayed in the +Work for an individual member.</p>

The sequence diagram only shows how a member&#8217;s profile image is called up and displayed. It doesn&#8217;t show how the member&#8217;s

<p><strong>Alternative 1:</strong> Storing the image filepath as a changeable attribute</p>

<p>Cons: The image file path attribute is exposed to the rest of the classes in +Work and may be unintentionally edited, causing
the member&#8217;s profile picture to be edited without the intention to.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2 (current choice):</strong> Storing the image filepath as a final attribute</p>
