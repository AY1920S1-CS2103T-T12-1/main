<p>+Work is a CLI application created by my team for NUS School of Computing&#8217;s CS2103T Software Engineering module.
In this module, each team is required to morph or enhance an existing CLI AddressBook application, to fit the needs of a
target group of users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our application, +Work, is a project management tool aimed at NUS project leaders. It allows project leaders to manage
their members, meeting times, task allocations as well as personal claims for items purchased. A user can use +Work to find
the most popular meeting time among his project members when calling for a meeting, and even add project tasks and members that are assigned under these tasks,
into +Work to better manage the project manpower.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="enhancements"><a class="link" href="#enhancements">2.1. Enhancements</a></h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: I added the ability to retrieve the overall statistics of tasks and members in +Work.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: This feature allows the user to retrieve statistics relating to tasks and members in +Work, including the
number of tasks and inventory items allocated to each member, and the proportion of tasks of different statuses, along with
the time spent on each task added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature increases the functionality of +Work because it gives the user a broad overview of the
project&#8217;s progress and members' responsibility allocation at a glance, which is one of the main goals of effective project management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: The statistics are displayed in the form of a Pie-Chart for easy comparison of data at a glance.
Implementation of the statistics code also requires the use of a newly introduced
mapping concept our team added to +Work, and required extensive consideration in the integration of the two implementations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: I added the ability for users to work with (add, delete, list, set image for) project members in +Work.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: This feature allows both members and tasks to be managed in one application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it adds another aspect of project management (member management) into +Work,
and allows different tasks and members to be assigned to one another. This allows
users to be able to draw connections between tasks and members when managing the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: One of the unique features that <code>Member</code> objects has is the ability to be assigned profile pictures. Users can
link an image on their laptop to a specific member in +Work, to set the image as the member&#8217;s profile photo. This was
challenging to implement because I had to ensure the User Interface (UI) would be able to accurately display the profile picture of each
member.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enhance the UI for members in +Work, which can include members' profile photos, as well as list tasks allocated to
each member under individual member cards</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The commands introduced by this statistics feature includes: <code>task-stats</code> and <code>member-stats</code>. These commands are facilitated by the class <code>Statistics</code>
that resides within model. The <code>Statistics</code> class implements the following operations:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Statistics#doCalculations()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Calculates the statistics needed using existing list of tasks, members and mappings.</p>

<li>
<p><code>Statistics#getPortionTasksByStatus()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Retrieves statistics of all existing tasks and number of tasks of each status.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These operations are exposed in the <code>Model</code> interface as <code>Model#doCalculations</code>, and <code>Model#getStatistics</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Statistics mechanism behaves at each step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> The user launches the application for the first time. The <code>Statistics</code> object stored by ProjectDashboard is initialised based on the data previously saved.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> The user executes the <code>task-stats</code> command to retrieve statistics related to the tasks in the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>task-stats</code> command obtains lists of all the members, tasks and mappings saved in the application, and uses the lists to form a Statistics object.

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect: Implementation of Statistics class</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> One statistics object for the entire ProjectDashboard</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Easy to implement, centralised class for all statistics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: May have performance issues due to calculations involving large amounts of tasks and members.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Individual statistic objects for members and tasks.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Ensures faster performance, more detailed statistics can be included</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Complicates the implementation of the statistics class, might not have enough time to implement it by v1.4</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Alternative 1</strong> was chosen given the time constraint in implementing the features in time for +Work Version 1.4.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect: Display of Statistics for Project Dashboard</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (current choice):</strong> Use a pie chart to represent information</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Increases the ease of workload comparison</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Decreases the amount of detail of individual tasks and members that are displayed</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Use a list to represent information</p>

</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because the team came to a consensus that the main objective of the Statistics feature in +Work is to provide the user with
an overview of all the project tasks and members, for ease of comparison, <strong>Alternative 1</strong> was chosen as it fits the purpose
more than Alternative 2 does.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="member-feature"><a class="link" href="#member-feature">4.2. Member Feature</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The member feature introduces the ability for +Work to deal with project members, in the same way it deals with project tasks.
This makes +Work a more comprehensive application because project tasks and members can be kept track of together.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="implementation-2"><a class="link" href="#implementation-2">4.2.1. Implementation</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>+Work&#8217;s members and their related commands are supported by a <code>Member</code> class that resides within model.
The following class diagram exposes the structure of the <code>Member</code> class, and shows how the different components relating to the Member class works together.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apart from the typical commands (<code>add-member</code>, <code>delete-member</code>, <code>find-member</code>) involved in such a central class, the member feature also introduces a <code>set-image</code> command.
The <code>set-image</code> command allows users to set an image in their computer as the profile picture of a member in +Work.
To accommodate the <code>set-image</code> command, the <code>Member</code> class has an alternative constructor that takes in the image filepath as a parameter to save it as an attribute to the member object, when <code>set-image</code> command is called.
Additionally, to support the command, the <code>Member</code> class implements the following operation:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Member#getImagePath()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Retrieves the filepath of the image stored in the user&#8217;s computer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Member#getImage()</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Retrieves the member&#8217;s image using the image filepath</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is an example usage scenario and how the set-image mechanism behaves at each step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> The user launches the application for the first time, and adds a team member into +Work. The member is displayed with a default profile picture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> The user executes the <code>set-image</code> command to set an image in their computer as the profile picture of a member in +Work..</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>set-image</code> command calls <code>Model#getFilteredMembersList()</code> to retrieve the Member that is to be edited.
A new member object is formed, with all the same parameters as the specified member object, and a new Image Filepath parameter.
<code>Model#setMember</code> is called to replace the old member object with the new one in +Work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sequence diagram shows how the <code>set-image</code> operation works.</p>

The image&#8217;s file path is stored in the Member object. If the image is shifted to another location, the file path stored becomes invalid, and the user has to call the <code>set-image</code> command again, with the new file path.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section describes the pros and cons of the current and other alternative implementations of the image attribute under members.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect: Storage of image under member</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1:</strong> Storing the image filepath as a changeable attribute</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Editing a member&#8217;s profile picture involves accessing the member and changing its file path attribute</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: The image file path attribute is exposed to the rest of the classes in +Work and may be unintentionally edited, causing
the member&#8217;s profile picture to be edited without the intention to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2 (current choice):</strong> Storing the image filepath as a final attribute</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Ensures the member&#8217;s image filepath remains unchangeable and specific to the member</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: A new member object has to be created to replace the member being edited every time the member&#8217;s profile
picture is updated</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Alternative 2</strong> was chosen to keep in line with the original structure of the Person object in AB3, with all attributes
being final and unchangeable.</p>
